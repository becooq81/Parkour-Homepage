## üîç Problem Statement 

<h3 align="center"> Administering medication to children poses unique challenges for blind parents, encompassing potential safety risks and emotional stress, underscoring the need for accessible medication management solutions and supportive resources.</h3>

> Most Common Medication Challenges for the Blind & Visually Impaired(VI)<br>
> ```
> 1. Identifying Medication
> 2. Understanding Medication Information
> 3. Using Liquid Medication
> ```

We learned that bilnd/VI parents struggle with giving medication to their children, especially with <b>identifying and understanding the medication</b> and <b>adjusting the right dosage of liquid medication.</b> They also expressed the desire to <b>independently manage their child‚Äôs medication</b> without relying on assistance. They feel <b>anxious</b> when giving medications to their child because of the risk of giving the wrong/expired  medication and exceeding the required liquid dosage.

Mobile Layer built with `Flutter` building the application‚Äôs user interface and handling logical operations. The user interface implements accessibility features using `Google Talk Back`, enhancing the app‚Äôs usability for VI users, and is responsible for providing a better user experience. 

For Machine Learning, `TensorFlow Lite` and `Google‚Äôs ML Kit for Flutter` are integrated into the `Flutter` mobile application. Using `TensorFlow Lite` for a YOLO model (trained with hand-crafted dataset) for bottle detection used when identifying the liquid amount in the container while using`Google‚Äôs ML Kit for Flutter` Text Recognition and Barcode Detection for identifing the medication packaging.
