## 🔍 Problem Statement 

<h3 align="center"> Giving medication is not only physically dangerous for their child, but also emotionally traumatic for them.</h3>

> Most Common Medication Challenges for the Blind & Visually Impaired(VI)<br>
> ```
> 1. Identifying Medication
> 2. Understanding Medication Information
> 3. Using Liquid Medication
> ```

During the unterview with VI parents, we learned that bilnd/VI parents struggle with giving medication to their children, especially with <b>identifying and understanding the medication</b> and <b>adjusting the right dosage of liquid medication.</b> They also expressed the desire to <b>independently manage their child’s medication</b> without relying on assistance. They have <b>anxiety</b> when giving medications to their child because of the risk of giving the wrong/expired  medication and exceeding the required liquid dosage.
